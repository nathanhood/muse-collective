Muse Collective
===============

This application is a tool for writers of all kinds. Within each
project you can make creativity boards which consist of a customizable
board where images, audio files, sticky notes, notepads and random poetry
tools are used to spur the creative process as well as collect ideas.
In addition, you can write and edit a working text draft, keeping a log
of restorable versions. A working audio draft can also be kept for songwriters.
Collaborators can be added to a project. Each edit is authored so as to track
who is doing what.
